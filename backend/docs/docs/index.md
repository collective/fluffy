This scaffold provides a ready-to-use environment for creating comprehensive documentation for Plone projects, based on [Plone Sphinx Theme](https://github.com/plone/plone-sphinx-theme).

Built with [Markedly Structured Text (MyST)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), this environment supports rich formatting, directives, and extensions tailored for technical documentation.

It's structured following the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation framework.
